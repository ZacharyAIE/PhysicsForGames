# Physics For Games

A Demo of a 2D Physics engine I made while studying.
The physics code can be found in the Project2D folder

This demo demonstrates: 

- Static and Dynamic Rigidbody physics
- circle, box and plane collision detections
- velocity
- angular velocity
- gravity
- soft body physics
- Left or Right Click to Spawn Squares or Circles
